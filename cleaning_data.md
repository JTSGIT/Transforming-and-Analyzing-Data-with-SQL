UPDATE public.all_sessions SET "totalTransactionRevenue" = COALESCE("totalTransactionRevenue", '0');
--This query provides the average revenue generated per session, helping gauge the site's monetization effectiveness.
ALTER TABLE public.all_sessions ALTER COLUMN "totalTransactionRevenue" TYPE numeric USING "totalTransactionRevenue"::numeric;
--Converting textual numeric columns to appropriate numeric data types
SELECT "channelGrouping", COUNT(*) as num_sessions
FROM public.all_sessions
GROUP BY "channelGrouping"
ORDER BY num_sessions DESC;
